Web Storage: 

web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser. Before HTML5,
application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request.
Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.

Local Storage : it is a predefined object in javascript, data stored in this will be available until you delete 
it from the browser

Session Storage : it is a predefined object in javascript, data stored in this will be available until you close 
the current application.

Syntax:

    localStorage.setItem(key, value);

    localStorage.getItem(key);

    localStorage.removeItem(key);

    localStorage.clear()


    sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);

    sessionStorage.getItem(key);

    sessionStorage.removeItem(key);

    sessionStorage.clear();

    

products.find(function(product) {
    return product.id === +req.params.productId
})
